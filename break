print("--- Simple Choice Menu ---")

while True:
    user_input = input("Type 'exit' to stop the loop, or anything else to continue: ")

    if user_input.lower() == "exit":
        print("Breaking out of the loop now...")
        break  # This stops the loop immediately
    
    print(f"You typed: '{user_input}'. Let's go again!\n")

print("Loop finished.")


OUTPUT:
Type 'exit' to stop the loop, or anything else to continue: exit
Breaking out of the loop now...
Loop finished.
